# File System Permissions Audit

## Overview
This repository documents a file system permissions audit for a research team at a large organization, ensuring only authorized users have access to sensitive data. As a cybersecurity professional, I examined existing permissions, compared them to an authorization policy, modified permissions to align with security requirements, and documented findings. The project showcases my Python skills, problem-solving, and commitment to securing organizational assets, using a lab environment with screenshots as evidence.

## Objectives
- Audit file system permissions for the research teamâ€™s directories.
- Identify unauthorized access and misconfigured permissions.
- Modify permissions to enforce least privilege (NIST CSF PR.AC-1).
- Provide recommendations for ongoing access control.

## Tools Used
- **Analysis**: Manual review of permissions (Linux: `ls -l`; Windows: `icacls`) in a lab environment.
- **Documentation**: PDF (audit report), Markdown, CSV, lab screenshots.

## Repository Structure

2. Review the report in `audit-report.pdf`.

## Disclaimer
This audit was conducted in a lab environment with hypothetical data. Always obtain explicit permission before auditing real systems to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards.
